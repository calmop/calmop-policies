<h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

<p>
This policy explains when refunds are issued and how cancellations are handled
for our ecommerce operations services.
</p>

<p>
By engaging our services, you agree to this policy.
</p>

<h2>1. No Free Trials</h2>

<p>
We do not offer free trials.
</p>

<p>
All services are paid services and begin only after payment and onboarding
requirements are completed.
</p>

<h2>2. Onboarding Fee</h2>

<p>
A one-time onboarding fee is charged at the start of the engagement.
</p>

<p>
This fee covers initial setup work, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access configuration</li>
  <li>Workflow setup</li>
  <li>Policy alignment</li>
  <li>Ownership handoff</li>
</ul>

<p>
The onboarding fee is non-refundable.
</p>

<h2>3. Monthly Subscription Fees</h2>

<p>
All services are billed monthly in advance.
</p>

<p>
Once a billing cycle has started:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monthly fees are non-refundable</li>
  <li>No partial refunds are offered for unused time</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Refund Eligibility</h2>

<p>
Refunds are issued only in limited and specific circumstances.
</p>

<p>
A refund may be issued only if services have not commenced due to a failure
on our side after payment and onboarding.
</p>

<p>
Once operational work has started, subscription fees are non-refundable.
</p>

<h2>5. 21-Day Ops Fit Guarantee</h2>

<p>
We offer a 21-Day Ops Fit Guarantee to help determine whether our services
are the right fit.
</p>

<p>
If, within the first 21 days, daily ecommerce operations do not feel clearly
off your plate, you may choose not to continue the engagement.
</p>

<p>
This guarantee:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is not a free trial</li>
  <li>Does not provide automatic refunds</li>
  <li>Exists solely to allow you to decide whether to continue</li>
</ul>

<p>
Payments already made remain non-refundable unless covered under
Section 4 of this policy.
</p>

<h2>6. Cancellation Policy</h2>

<p>
You may cancel your subscription at any time by providing notice before
your next billing date.
</p>

<p>
Upon cancellation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Services will continue until the end of the current billing period</li>
  <li>No further charges will be applied after the current billing cycle</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Client-Related Delays & Ineligibility for Refunds</h2>

<p>
Refunds will not be issued for dissatisfaction or delays caused by:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Late or incomplete access to required systems</li>
  <li>Missing, unclear, or changing policies</li>
  <li>Limited communication or cooperation from the client</li>
  <li>Operational volume or complexity beyond initial expectations</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Chargebacks & Payment Disputes</h2>

<p>
Initiating chargebacks or payment disputes without first contacting us
may result in immediate service termination.
</p>

<p>
Refund eligibility does not extend to chargebacks initiated without
prior communication.
</p>

<h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>

<p>
We may update this Refund & Cancellation Policy from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised date.
